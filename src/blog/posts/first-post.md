This is the first post and it's just for testing out the blog feature on this site. To make a simple post, just add a markdown file in the `blog/posts` directory. Copy an existing example.

Change the header info:
```
---
title: Hello, world
author: marisademeglio
---
```

And add yourself to the `_data\authors.json` file if you like, e.g.:
```
"marisademeglio": {
    "name": "Marisa DeMeglio",
    "organization": "DAISY Consortium",
    "link": "daisy.org"
}
```
