This is the first post and it's just for testing out the blog feature on this site. To make a simple post, just add a markdown file in the `blog/posts` directory. Copy an existing example.

Change the header info:
```
---
title: My new title
author: marisademeglio
date: 2019-04-18
---
```

And add yourself to the `_data/authors.json` file if you like, e.g.:
```
"marisademeglio": {
    "name": "Marisa DeMeglio",
    "organization": "DAISY Consortium",
    "link": "daisy.org"
}
```

Blog posts get shown on the main blog page, most recent first (so use the date field!). Blog posts get blog navigation links at the bottom of the page, as well as a section called "Related Posts", containing other posts with any of the same tags as this one.
