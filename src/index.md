# Welcome

This is the home of Canadian Accessible Publishing on the web! The idea to have this site came out of the Accessible Publishing Summit in Toronto, 2019, and aims to build bridges between the many and varied accessibility resources out there in the world, and those who want to use them in the context of publishing in Canada.
